### Tailwind CSS is the only framework. Itâ€™s easy to customize, adapts to any design, and the build size is tiny.

### Utility classes help you work within the constraints of a system instead of littering your stylesheets with arbitrary values. They make it easy to be consistent with color choices, spacing, typography, shadows, and everything else that makes up a well-engineered design system.

### Because Tailwind is so low-level, it never encourages you to design the same site twice. Even with the same color palette and sizing scale, it's easy to build the same component with a completely different look in the next project.



## Why rems not px ?

## Tailwind CSS uses rems in all units. The point of rem is that you can (not saying you should) scale everything proportionally by changing the root font size. With px you can't.

## In this lab, you are supposed to scale everything by changing the px value of the html element.
